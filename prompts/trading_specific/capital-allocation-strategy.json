  "content": "Develop a dynamic capital allocation system that implements a [STRATEGY_NAME] approach. The system should distribute capital among trading algorithms based on [ALLOCATION_CRITERIA], while respecting position sizing limits and risk management rules. Include mechanisms to adjust allocations based on changing market conditions.",
  "analysis": "This prompt addresses the critical question of how to distribute limited capital across multiple strategies. The capital allocation decision directly impacts overall system returnsâ€”even excellent strategies will underperform if underfunded, while poor strategies may drain resources if overfunded.",
  "strengths": [
    "Directly impacts trading returns",
    "Balances performance with risk management",
    "Adapts to changing market conditions",
    "Provides a comprehensive framework for capital management"
  ],
  "example": "Develop a dynamic capital allocation system that implements a \"Performance-Weighted\" approach. The system should distribute capital among trading algorithms based on risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio), win rate, and profit consistency, while respecting position sizing limits and risk management rules. No single algorithm should receive more than 20% of total capital regardless of performance, and include mechanisms to adjust allocations based on changing market conditions.",
