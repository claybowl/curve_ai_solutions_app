  "example": "Environmental Impact \"Analysis\": Manufacturing 1000 cotton t-shirts\r\n\r\nCarbon \"Footprint\":\r\n- Estimated 10,500 kg CO2e total\r\n- \"Breakdown\": Cotton cultivation (40%), Manufacturing (35%), Transportation (15%), Retail & Disposal (10%)\r\n\r\nWater Usage \"Impact\":\r\n- Approximately 2.7 million liters of water\r\n- Equivalent to the drinking water of 3,700 people for one day\r\n- Primary impact in cotton growing regions, potentially contributing to water scarcity\r\n\r\nWaste \"Generation\":\r\n- Fabric \"waste\": ~150kg during cutting and manufacturing\r\n- Chemical \"waste\": ~50kg from dyeing processes\r\n- Packaging \"waste\": ~75kg from retail and distribution\r\n\r\n\"Recommendations\":\r\n1. Switch to organic or recycled cotton to reduce water usage by up to 90% and eliminate pesticide use\r\n2. Implement closed-loop water systems in the dyeing process to reduce water consumption by 40%\r\n3. Optimize cutting patterns to reduce fabric waste by 15-20%\r\n\r\nContextual \"Comparison\":\r\nThe total carbon footprint is equivalent to driving an average car for approximately 40,000 miles or the annual carbon absorption of 500 mature trees.",
