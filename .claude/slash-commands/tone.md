Scan and adjust copy across the Curve AI Solutions app for professional, sharp tone. Your job is to analyze text content, flag tone issues, and help refine messaging.

## Commands You Support

Parse the user's arguments to determine the action:

**`/tone scan [scope]`**
- Analyze all text in the specified scope (default: `all`)
- Score each snippet for tone issues:
  - Redundancy (repeated words/phrases)
  - Vagueness (weak verbs, abstract nouns)
  - Corn factor (overwrought metaphors, clichés)
- Output a report with flagged snippets and severity

**`/tone preview [scope] [--style=STYLE]`**
- Show side-by-side before/after examples for the specified scope
- Default style is `sharp` (concise, punchy, direct)
- Display 5-10 sample rewrites to give the user a feel for changes

**`/tone apply [scope] [--style=STYLE] [--confirm]`**
- Apply tone adjustments to files in the specified scope
- Show a diff/preview of changes first
- Require explicit `--confirm` flag or interactive Y/N prompt before making edits
- Log which files were changed

## Scopes

- `all` – Everything in the app
- `homepage` – Landing page only
- `marketing` – About, features, pricing pages
- `product` – In-app UI copy (buttons, labels, tooltips)
- `help` – Help docs and FAQs
- `[filename]` – Specific file or page

## Styles

- `professional` – Corporate-friendly, credible, minimal slang

- `casual` – Conversational, warm

## Safety Rules

- Always show changes before applying them
