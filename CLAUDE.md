# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Curve AI Solutions is a Next.js web application that offers AI consultation services, assessments, and tools. The platform includes user authentication, an admin dashboard, client-facing interfaces, and a blog section using Notion as a CMS.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

## Database Setup

The application uses PostgreSQL hosted on Neon.tech. To set up the database:

1. Create a `.env.local` file with your database credentials:

```
# Database connection 
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgresql://username:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

2. Initialize the database schema using the SQL in `db-schema.sql`

## Core Architecture

### 1. Next.js App Router Structure

- Routes and pages are defined in the `/app` directory
- API endpoints are in `/app/api/`

### 2. Authentication System

- **Primary**: Supabase Authentication with row-level security
- Authentication logic in `/lib/auth.ts` and `/providers/auth-provider.tsx`
- User roles: admin and client with role-based permissions stored in profiles table
- Middleware protection for admin routes and authenticated areas
- Admin creation via `/create-admin` page or `/api/setup` endpoint

### 3. Database Layer

- **Primary**: Supabase PostgreSQL with profiles table for user management
- **Legacy**: Neon PostgreSQL for backward compatibility (some features)
- Database utilities in `/lib/db.ts`, `/lib/db-safe.ts`, and Supabase clients
- Server actions for secure database operations

### 4. Admin Dashboard

- Admin routes in `/app/admin/` with responsive design
- User, consultation, assessment, blog, and tools management
- Stats and activity tracking with visual analytics
- Role-based access control via middleware

### 5. Client-Facing Features

- AI assessments and consultation requests
- Solutions showcase and prompt library
- User profiles and dashboard
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 6. Blog Integration (Disabled)

- Blog functionality temporarily disabled for build stability
- Previous Notion integration can be re-enabled if needed
- Static content management for now

## Environment Variables

**Required for Supabase Authentication:**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Supabase service role key for admin operations

**Legacy Database (for compatibility):**

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (Neon)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret for any remaining NextAuth compatibility
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Application URL

**Optional APIs:**

- `XAI_API_KEY`: XAI API for AI features
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Email service integration

## Deployment Process

The application is deployed on Vercel. Key deployment requirements:

- Node.js v18+
- Set all environment variables in Vercel project settings
- Database must be accessible from Vercel's deployment region

## Ideas/Backlog

## Workflows/Guidelines

### How to Mark a Task as Complete

To mark a task as complete, change the checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`. For example:

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
```

### Moving Tasks Between Sections

When moving a task, cut the entire task item (including sub-bullets) from its current section and paste it under the appropriate new heading (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").

### Adding New Tasks

Add new tasks under the "To Do" section using the `-[ ] ` format.



### About Us

t Curve AI Solutions, we're not just another tech company. We're a team of innovators, problem-solvers, and business enthusiasts who believe that artificial intelligence should be accessible, practical, and valuable for businesses of all sizesâ€”including yours.

Our Story
Founded in Tulsa with a simple yet powerful vision: to demystify AI and make it work for real businesses facing real challenges. We saw too many small business owners feeling left behind by the AI revolutionâ€”either intimidated by the technical complexity or unsure how this technology could actually improve their bottom line.

That's when we asked ourselves: What if AI could be both powerful AND approachable? What if we could translate the complex world of artificial intelligence into solutions that any business owner could understand, implement, and benefit from immediately?

What We Do
We create custom AI chatbots and workflow solutions (we call them Agentic AI Solutions) that handle the mundane, repetitive tasks consuming your valuable time. Our CurveAI technology doesn't just process dataâ€”it understands context, learns your business needs, and communicates with a personality tailored to your company culture.

Simplify Complex Processes
We translate technical concepts into everyday language that anyone can understand.

Automate Data Analysis
We automate data analysis and integration that would otherwise take hours of manual work.

Reduce Operational Costs
We streamline workflows and eliminate inefficiencies to reduce your operational costs.

Free Up Your Time
We help you focus on what truly mattersâ€”growing your business and serving your customers.

Why Small Business Owners Choose Us
Unlike large corporate AI solutions that require teams of engineers to implement, or basic chatbots that can only follow simple scripts, our technology strikes the perfect balance: sophisticated enough to deliver real results, simple enough that you don't need a computer science degree to use it.

When you work with Curve AI Solutions, you get:

Practical AI tools designed for your specific business challengesâ€”not theoretical capabilities
Solutions that speak humanâ€”no technical jargon, no endless documentation
Measurable results with clear ROIâ€”we're about improving your business, not just showcasing fancy technology
A partner who understands your business needs and translates them into effective AI implementations
Our Approach
We believe in starting with your business problems, not with technology. Our process is straightforward:

Listen to understand your specific challenges and goals
Design a customized AI solution that addresses your unique needs
Implement the technology seamlessly into your existing workflows
Measure the results to ensure you're getting real value
Refine the solution based on feedback and changing business needs
The Magic Behind Our Solutions
While we keep the technical talk to a minimum when working with clients, rest assured that under the hood, our solutions leverage cutting-edge AI frameworks and advanced software engineering. Our team brings expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, and data integrationâ€”all so you don't have to.

Community Commitment
We're deeply invested in the Tulsa business community and beyond. Through our AI Literacy Program, we're helping local business leaders, professionals, and interested parties understand and leverage AI technologies. Our seminars, online content, and collaborations with local businesses bring AI education closer to where people live and work.

By building strategic partnerships with other tech companies, educational institutions, and industry leaders, we're creating an ecosystem where businesses of all sizes can thrive in the digital age.

What Sets Us Apart
The difference is in our philosophy: we believe AI should work for you, not the other way around. Many AI companies make you adapt to their technology; we adapt our technology to fit your business.

Our solutions don't require you to learn new systems, hire technical staff, or completely overhaul your operations. Instead, we meet you where you are and enhance what you're already doing.

And unlike impersonal chatbots or generic AI tools, our solutions come with personalities that reflect your brand and create engaging experiences for both your team and your customers.
