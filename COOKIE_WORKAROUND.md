# Supabase Auth Cookie Workaround

This document describes the cookie persistence issue identified in the Supabase authentication implementation and the workaround implemented.

## The Problem

The authentication system was failing due to a critical issue: **Supabase auth cookies were not being properly set in the browser**. 

Symptoms:
- Authentication API calls succeeded (valid tokens returned)
- Users would get stuck in redirect loops between login and dashboard
- Debug logs showed no Supabase cookies being set
- Sessions weren't persisting between page navigations

Root cause: There appears to be an issue with how Supabase, Next.js routing, and cookie handling interact in this application environment.

## The Solution: LocalStorage-Based Authentication

Instead of relying on cookies for session persistence, a localStorage-based approach has been implemented:

### Components Created:

1. **Session Storage Utility** (`lib/session-storage.ts`)
   - Provides functions to save, load, validate, and clear sessions in localStorage
   - Handles session expiration checking
   - Browser-only implementation with safety checks

2. **LocalStorage Login Form** (`components/auth/local-storage-login-form.tsx`)
   - Uses direct Supabase auth API with cookies disabled
   - Explicitly stores session information in localStorage
   - Navigates to localStorage-specific dashboard on success

3. **LocalStorage Dashboard** (`app/dashboard-local/page.tsx`)
   - Loads session data from localStorage instead of cookies
   - Validates session expiration before showing dashboard
   - Similar UI to the regular dashboard

4. **Login Page** (`app/login-local/page.tsx`)
   - Hosts the localStorage login form
   - Provides clear information about the approach

## How to Use

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login-local
2. Log in with your Supabase credentials
3. After successful login, you'll be redirected to /dashboard-local
4. The dashboard will load your user information from localStorage

## Technical Implementation

The solution works around the cookie issues by:

1. **Bypassing Supabase's built-in persistence mechanisms**:
   ```typescript
   const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
     auth: {
       persistSession: false, // Disable built-in persistence
       autoRefreshToken: false,
       detectSessionInUrl: false
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Manually saving session data**:
   ```typescript
   // Save session to localStorage
   localStorage.setItem(SESSION_KEY, JSON.stringify({
     access_token: session.access_token,
     refresh_token: session.refresh_token,
     expires_at: session.expires_at,
     user: { /* user data */ }
   }))
   ```

3. **Validating session expiration**:
   ```typescript
   // Check if session has expired
   const expiresAt = session.expires_at * 1000 // Convert to milliseconds
   const now = Date.now()
   return expiresAt > now
   ```

4. **Loading session on page load**:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Check for valid session
     if (!hasValidSession()) {
       router.push('/login-local')
       return
     }
     
     // Load the session data
     const session = loadSession()
     setUser(session.user)
   }, [])
   ```

## Advantages

1. **Reliability**: Not dependent on browser cookie implementations or third-party cookie settings
2. **Simplicity**: Direct control over session data without relying on Supabase's opaque mechanisms
3. **Debuggability**: Easier to inspect and validate session state in browser devtools
4. **Immediate fix**: Provides a working solution without needing to diagnose complex cookie issues

## Limitations

1. **Security**: LocalStorage is slightly less secure than HTTPOnly cookies (vulnerable to XSS)
2. **Parallel auth systems**: This approach creates a parallel auth system distinct from the original
3. **No auto-refresh**: Tokens aren't automatically refreshed (would need to be implemented)
4. **Manual integration**: Would need to be integrated with other parts of the application

## Next Steps

1. Decide whether to:
   - Continue using the localStorage-based approach as a permanent solution
   - Spend more time debugging the underlying cookie issues
   - Consider a hybrid approach where cookies are used when available

2. If continuing with localStorage:
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Enhance security with encryption
   - Roll out to all authenticated parts of the application

3. For a more permanent solution:
   - Consider using the Supabase client in a more controlled way
   - Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
   - Ensure consistent auth state management across the application
