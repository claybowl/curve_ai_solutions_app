---

## Test 1: Database Connection & Schema ‚úÖ

### What We're Testing
Verify that the database is properly configured with all tables, RLS policies, and sample data.

### Steps
1. Open Supabase Dashboard (https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Tables
3. Verify the following tables exist:
   - `profiles` (8 rows)
   - `n8n_workflows` (6 rows)
   - `n8n_workflow_executions` (0 rows initially)
   - `solutions` (4 rows)
   - `ai_tools` (6 rows)
   - All other tables from the schema

### Expected Result
‚úÖ All 23 tables visible
‚úÖ RLS enabled on all tables (green shield icon)
‚úÖ Sample data present in key tables

### Troubleshooting
- **Tables missing?** Run migrations via MCP server
- **No RLS?** Check migration logs for errors

---

## Test 2: Row Level Security (RLS) Policies üîí

### What We're Testing
Verify that users can only access data they're authorized to see.

### Steps

#### Test 2A: Regular User Access
1. Login as a regular user (non-admin)
2. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console
3. Run this code:
```javascript
const { data: workflows } = await supabase
  .from('n8n_workflows')
  .select('*')
console.log('Workflows:', workflows)
```

**Expected Result:** `[]` (empty array - regular users can't see workflows)

4. Run this code:
```javascript
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
console.log('Profiles:', profile)
```

**Expected Result:** Only YOUR profile returned (1 row)

#### Test 2B: Admin User Access
1. Login as an admin user
2. Run the same workflow query:
```javascript
const { data: workflows } = await supabase
  .from('n8n_workflows')
  .select('*')
console.log('Workflows:', workflows)
```

**Expected Result:** All 6 workflows returned

3. Run the profiles query:
```javascript
const { data: profiles } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
console.log('Profiles:', profiles)
```

**Expected Result:** All 8 profiles returned

### Expected Results Summary
‚úÖ Regular users see only their own data
‚úÖ Admins see all data
‚úÖ Unauthorized access blocked

### Troubleshooting
- **Getting all data as regular user?** Check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
- **Can't access anything?** Verify user role in profiles table

## Test 3: N8N Workflow Dashboard ü§ñ

### What We're Testing
The AI Agents admin dashboard displays workflows and allows triggering them.

### Steps
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/ai-agents`
2. Verify you see:
   - 3 stat cards (Total Workflows, Total Executions, Recent Activity)
   - 6 workflow cards with icons and descriptions
   - Execution history table (empty initially)

3. Click on any workflow card's **"Trigger Workflow"** button
4. Observe:
   - Button shows "Executing..." with loading spinner
   - After a few seconds, toast notification appears
   - Stats update automatically
   - Execution appears in history table

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Dashboard displays all workflows
‚úÖ Workflow trigger creates execution record
‚úÖ Stats update after execution
‚úÖ Execution history shows new entry

### Troubleshooting
- **No workflows showing?** Check database: `SELECT * FROM n8n_workflows`
- **Trigger fails?** Workflow might not have webhook URL configured
- **Permission denied?** Ensure you're logged in as admin

---

## Test 4: TypeScript Type Safety üí™

### What We're Testing
Verify that database queries have full TypeScript support.

### Steps
1. Open `app/actions/workflow-actions.ts`
2. Add this code:
```typescript
import { Tables } from '@/types/database.types'

// This should have full IntelliSense
type WorkflowRow = Tables<'n8n_workflows'>

// Try accessing a property - you should see autocomplete
const exampleWorkflow: WorkflowRow = {
  id: 'test',
  name: 'Test Workflow',
  // VS Code should suggest all other fields
}
```

3. Type an incorrect field name and observe the TypeScript error

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Full IntelliSense for all table columns
‚úÖ TypeScript errors for invalid field names
‚úÖ Autocomplete for table names in `.from()`

### Troubleshooting
- **No types showing?** Restart TypeScript server in VS Code
- **Import errors?** Verify `types/database.types.ts` exists
- **Types outdated?** Regenerate with `mcp_supabase_generate_typescript_types()`

---

## Test 5: Real-time Workflow Monitoring üî¥

### What We're Testing
Live updates using Supabase Realtime - no page refresh needed!

### Steps
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/ai-agents/test-realtime`
2. Verify you see:
   - Left column: Workflow cards
   - Right column: Live Execution Monitor
   - Green connection status dot

3. **Multi-tab Test:**
   - Open the same page in 2 browser tabs side by side
   - In Tab 1: Click "Trigger Workflow"
   - In Tab 2: Watch the execution appear automatically (no refresh!)

4. **Status Updates:**
   - Watch the execution status change from "Pending" ‚Üí "Running" ‚Üí "Success/Failed"
   - Duration updates automatically when execution completes

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Green "Connected" indicator shows WebSocket is active
‚úÖ New executions appear in real-time without refresh
‚úÖ Updates sync across multiple browser tabs
‚úÖ Status badges update automatically

### Troubleshooting
- **Disconnected status?** Check Supabase Realtime is enabled on `n8n_workflow_executions` table
- **No updates?** Check browser console for subscription errors
- **Connection drops?** Restart dev server

---

## Test 6: Solutions Showcase üìä

### What We're Testing
Sample case studies are properly stored and displayed.

### Steps
1. Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT 
  title, 
  client_name, 
  client_industry,
  status,
  is_featured 
FROM solutions 
WHERE status = 'published';
```

2. Expected: 3 published solutions:
   - "Automated Customer Support with AI Chatbot" (Retail)
   - "Lead Qualification Automation" (Marketing)
   - "Business Process Analysis" (Manufacturing)

3. Navigate to solutions page (if exists) and verify they display correctly

### Expected Results
‚úÖ 3+ solutions in database
‚úÖ All have complete data (client info, metrics, testimonials)
‚úÖ RLS allows public viewing of published solutions

### Troubleshooting
- **No solutions?** Run the sample data insert from `QUICK_START_GUIDE_CLAY.md`
- **Can't view as regular user?** Check RLS policy `"Anyone can view published solutions"`

## Test 7: Database Functions & Triggers ‚öôÔ∏è

### What We're Testing
Auto-update timestamps, execution duration calculation, and other database automation.

### Steps

#### Test 7A: Auto-Update Timestamps
1. Update a workflow:
```sql
UPDATE n8n_workflows 
SET description = 'Updated description' 
WHERE name = 'New Consultation Alert';
```

2. Check the `updated_at` field:
```sql
SELECT name, updated_at FROM n8n_workflows 
WHERE name = 'New Consultation Alert';
```

**Expected:** `updated_at` should be current timestamp

#### Test 7B: Execution Duration Calculation
1. Create a test execution:
```sql
INSERT INTO n8n_workflow_executions (workflow_id, status, started_at)
SELECT id, 'running', NOW() 
FROM n8n_workflows 
LIMIT 1;
```

2. Update with completion time:
```sql
UPDATE n8n_workflow_executions 
SET status = 'success', completed_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '30 seconds'
WHERE status = 'running';
```

3. Check duration:
```sql
SELECT status, duration_seconds 
FROM n8n_workflow_executions 
ORDER BY started_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected:** `duration_seconds` should be `30`

#### Test 7C: Workflow Stats Auto-Update
1. Note current execution count:
```sql
SELECT name, execution_count FROM n8n_workflows LIMIT 1;
```

2. Mark an execution as successful (from Test 7B)
3. Check execution count again

**Expected:** `execution_count` increased by 1

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Timestamps update automatically
‚úÖ Duration calculated on execution completion
‚úÖ Workflow stats increment on successful execution

### Troubleshooting
- **Timestamps not updating?** Check trigger exists: `update_profiles_updated_at`
- **Duration not calculated?** Check trigger: `calculate_duration_trigger`
- **Stats not updating?** Check trigger: `update_workflow_stats_trigger`

---

## Test 8: Performance & Indexing üöÄ

### What We're Testing
Database queries are fast and indexes are being used.

### Steps
1. In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Query Performance
2. Run this query:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM n8n_workflows 
WHERE is_active = true 
ORDER BY name;
```

3. Look for "Index Scan" in the output (not "Seq Scan")

4. Test a complex query:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
  w.name,
  COUNT(e.id) as total_executions,
  AVG(e.duration_seconds) as avg_duration
FROM n8n_workflows w
LEFT JOIN n8n_workflow_executions e ON w.id = e.workflow_id
WHERE w.is_active = true
GROUP BY w.id, w.name;
```

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Queries use indexes (Index Scan, not Seq Scan)
‚úÖ Query time < 10ms for most queries
‚úÖ Complex joins perform well

### Troubleshooting
- **Slow queries?** Check if indexes exist: `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'n8n_workflows'`
- **Sequential scans?** Index might not be optimal for query pattern

## Test 9: Error Handling & Edge Cases üõ°Ô∏è

### What We're Testing
Application handles errors gracefully.

### Steps

#### Test 9A: Invalid Workflow Trigger
1. Try to execute a workflow without webhook URL:
```typescript
await executeWorkflow('workflow-id-with-no-webhook', {})
```

**Expected:** Error message: "Workflow does not have a webhook URL configured"

#### Test 9B: Unauthorized Access
1. Logout (or use regular user)
2. Try to access admin dashboard: `/admin/ai-agents`

**Expected:** Redirect to login or "Access Denied" message

#### Test 9C: Database Connection Loss
1. Temporarily disconnect from internet
2. Try to trigger a workflow

**Expected:** User-friendly error message, not a crash

### Expected Results
‚úÖ Errors are caught and displayed to user
‚úÖ No uncaught exceptions or crashes
‚úÖ Graceful degradation when services unavailable

---

## Test 10: Migration History & Rollback üîÑ

### What We're Testing
All migrations applied successfully and can be tracked.

### Steps
1. Check applied migrations:
```sql
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations 
ORDER BY version DESC;
```

**Expected:** 9 migrations listed

2. Verify specific migrations:
```sql
SELECT version, name 
FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations 
WHERE name LIKE '%n8n%';
```

**Expected:** At least 2 n8n-related migrations

### Expected Results
‚úÖ All migrations have timestamps
‚úÖ No failed migrations
‚úÖ Migrations applied in correct order
