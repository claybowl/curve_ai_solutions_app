## 🔥 What to Test First

### 1. Admin Dashboard - AI Agents
The N8N workflow dashboard is already built and ready:

```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/admin/ai-agents
```

**What you'll see:**
- 📊 Stats cards showing workflow counts
- 🎯 Workflow cards with trigger buttons
- 📋 Execution history table
- 🔄 Real-time updates when workflows execute

**Try this:**
1. Click any workflow card's "Run Workflow" button
2. Watch the execution status update in real-time
3. View results in the execution history table

### 2. Test Database Security
Verify RLS policies are working:

```typescript
// Login as a regular user
// Try to access admin resources
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('n8n_workflows')
  .select('*')
// Should return empty array (admin-only!)

// View your own profile
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
// Should only return YOUR profile
```

### 3. Check the Solutions Page
View your sample success stories:

```bash
# Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/solutions
```

You should see 3 beautiful case studies with:
- Client testimonials
- Metrics and results
- Tools used
- Industry tags

## 📝 Next Actions for You

### Immediate (Required)
1. **Test the AI Agents Dashboard**
   - Go to `/admin/ai-agents`
   - Click "Run Workflow" on any workflow
   - Verify it creates an execution record

2. **Set Up N8N Webhooks** (if you have n8n running)
   - Update the sample workflows with real webhook URLs:
   ```sql
   UPDATE n8n_workflows 
   SET n8n_webhook_url = 'your-actual-webhook-url'
   WHERE name = 'New Consultation Alert';
   ```

3. **Review Security Policies**
   - Check Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Policies
   - Verify all tables have RLS enabled (green checkmark)

### Soon (Recommended)
1. **Add Real Workflow Data**
   - Replace sample workflows with your actual n8n workflows
   - Update webhook URLs
   - Test execution from admin dashboard

2. **Customize Solutions Showcase**
   - Add your real client success stories
   - Upload client logos
   - Add more metrics

3. **Enable Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Add live updates to admin dashboard components
   - Show workflow execution progress in real-time

### Later (Nice to Have)
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Use Supabase dashboard to monitor query performance
   - Check slow query logs
   - Review index usage

2. **Add More Workflows**
   - Create workflows for:
     - Assessment completion notifications
     - New user onboarding sequences
     - Monthly reporting automation
     - Lead scoring and routing

## 🛠️ Developer Reference

### Database Access via MCP
You can manage the database using the MCP server tools:

```typescript
// List all tables
mcp_supabase_list_tables({ schemas: ["public"] })

// Execute SQL
mcp_supabase_execute_sql({ 
  query: "SELECT * FROM n8n_workflows" 
})

// Apply migration
mcp_supabase_apply_migration({
  name: "migration_name",
  query: "-- your SQL here"
})

// Generate TypeScript types
mcp_supabase_generate_typescript_types()
```

### TypeScript Usage
```typescript
import { Database, Tables } from '@/types/database.types'
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase-client'

// Fully typed queries
const supabase = createClient()

// Get workflows (typed automatically!)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('n8n_workflows')
  .select('*')
  
// data is typed as Tables<'n8n_workflows'>[]
```

### Real-time Subscriptions
```typescript
// Subscribe to workflow executions
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('workflow-updates')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { 
      event: '*', 
      schema: 'public', 
      table: 'n8n_workflow_executions' 
    }, 
    (payload) => {
      console.log('Execution updated!', payload.new)
      // Update your UI here
    }
  )
  .subscribe()

// Don't forget to unsubscribe!
subscription.unsubscribe()
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No workflows showing in dashboard"
**Solution:** The sample workflows should be there. Check:
```sql
SELECT * FROM n8n_workflows;
```
If empty, they might not have been inserted. Run:
```sql
INSERT INTO public.n8n_workflows (name, description, category, icon, color) 
VALUES 
  ('New Consultation Alert', 'Sends email when consultation requested', 'consultation', '📧', 'blue'),
  ('Lead Qualification Agent', 'Scores and prioritizes leads', 'lead_management', '👥', 'green'),
  ('Weekly Report Generator', 'Generates weekly analytics', 'reporting', '📊', 'purple');
```

### "Permission denied for table..."
**Solution:** RLS policy blocking you. Make sure your user has the `admin` role:
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### "TypeScript errors in database queries"
**Solution:** Regenerate types:
```bash
# Via MCP
mcp_supabase_generate_typescript_types()

# Or manually
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > types/database.types.ts
```

### "Realtime subscriptions not working"
**Solution:** Check if table is in publication:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
```
