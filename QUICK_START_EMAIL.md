## Get Emails Working in 3 Steps

### Step 1️⃣: Sign Up for Email Service

**Pick ONE:**

**Option A: Resend (Recommended)** ⭐
- Go to: https://resend.com/login
- Click "Sign Up"
- Create account with your email
- Done! (Free tier available)

**Option B: SendGrid**
- Go to: https://sendgrid.com
- Click "Sign Up"
- Create account
- Done! (Free tier available)

---

### Step 2️⃣: Get Your API Key

**If using Resend:**
1. Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key (looks like: `re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

**If using SendGrid:**
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key (looks like: `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

---

### Step 3️⃣: Add to `.env.local`

In your project root, create or edit `.env.local`:

**For Resend:**
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**For SendGrid:**
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then **restart your dev server**:
```bash
# Stop: Press Ctrl+C in terminal
# Restart:
pnpm dev
```

## 🧪 Test It

1. Go to the assessment page in your browser
2. Fill out a few assessment questions
3. Click "Submit Assessment"
4. Check your email for the notification!

## 📧 What You'll Receive

An email to **donjon.systems@gmail.com** with:
- ✅ Assessment submitted confirmation
- 📊 Overall score (out of 10)
- 📈 Completion percentage
- 📋 Table with all your questions and answers
- ⏰ Submission timestamp

---

## ❌ If It Doesn't Work

**Check these in order:**

1. ✅ Did you add the API key to `.env.local`?
2. ✅ Did you restart the dev server?
3. ✅ Is the email in your spam folder?
4. ✅ Is the API key correct? (Check for typos)
5. ✅ Is the API key active? (Check email service dashboard)

**For debugging:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check server terminal for errors
- Look for "sendAssessmentEmail" messages
