# LocalStorage-Based Authentication Solution

This document describes the localStorage-based authentication solution implemented to work around cookie issues in the application.

## Overview

The localStorage approach provides a complete authentication solution that:

1. Bypasses cookie-related issues by storing session data in localStorage
2. Supports both client and admin user roles with appropriate redirects
3. Validates session expiration to ensure security
4. Provides an easy-to-use login experience

## Components Created

### 1. Core Utilities

- `lib/session-storage.ts` - Core functions for localStorage-based auth:
  - `saveSession`: Stores session data securely in localStorage
  - `loadSession`: Retrieves session data
  - `hasValidSession`: Checks if session exists and hasn't expired
  - `isUserAdmin`: Checks if current user has admin role
  - `clearSession`: Logs out by removing session data

### 2. User Interfaces

- **Login Page** (`app/login-local/page.tsx`)
  - Hosts `LocalStorageLoginForm` component
  - Entry point for authentication

- **Client Dashboard** (`app/dashboard-local/page.tsx`)
  - Client-specific dashboard for non-admin users
  - Loads user data from localStorage

- **Admin Dashboard** (`app/admin-local/page.tsx`)
  - Admin interface with sidebar navigation
  - Only accessible to users with admin role
  - Protected by checks in both component and layout

### 3. Components

- **LocalStorage Login Form** (`components/auth/local-storage-login-form.tsx`)
  - Uses Supabase auth with cookies disabled
  - Redirects to admin dashboard for admin users
  - Redirects to client dashboard for client users

## How It Works

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   ```
   User → Login Form → Supabase Auth → Save Session → Redirect Based on Role
   ```

2. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions are stored in localStorage with the key 'curve_ai_auth_session'
   - Session includes tokens, expiration time, and user data
   - Sessions are validated on each page load

3. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Admin users are redirected to `/admin-local`
   - Client users are redirected to `/dashboard-local`
   - Admin routes are protected in both page and layout components

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Session expiration is enforced to prevent stale sessions
   - Only necessary user data is stored in localStorage
   - Sessions can be cleared via logout

## Usage Instructions

To use the localStorage-based authentication:

1. Navigate to `/login-local`
2. Enter your Supabase credentials
3. You will be automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on your role:
   - `/admin-local` for admin users
   - `/dashboard-local` for client users

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Works reliably regardless of cookie issues
- Simple implementation with clear separation of concerns
- Supports role-based redirects and access control
- Easily debuggable with clear session storage

### Limitations
- LocalStorage is potentially less secure than HTTPOnly cookies
- No automatic token refresh (would need to be added)
- Separate implementation from the main auth system
- Not suitable for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) contexts

## Further Improvements

The solution could be enhanced with:

1. **Token refresh** - Implement auto-refresh for long sessions
2. **Encryption** - Add client-side encryption for stored tokens
3. **Hybrid approach** - Fall back to localStorage only when cookies fail
4. **Session timeout UI** - Add interface for session expiration warnings
